Reflection & Summation: 
conversation, ambiguity,
incompleteness & resolution. The conversations
that I have had, & the ones that 
I have listened to I prize
dearly. Particular conversations
about drawing as a (re)capturing
of the human presence, and the
need for high resolution to
capture & represent — to signal —
ambiguity and the incompleteness
of thought. Scott McCloud was
invoked, and I do so again with his observation that
ambiguity & incompleteness in
representation opens the opportunity
for — and, indeed demands or
compels — us to project ourselves
into the absence & to complete the
gesture.
